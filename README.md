# Cancer Cell Segmentation using TensorFlow and FastAPI

In this project, I created a `FastAPI` application that takes a `pretrained model` to detect and segment cancer cells from an image and make predictions with the help of the model. 

I have used `FastAPI` to create an `endpoint` (which is localhost in our case) which can be queried with `Postman` or in the `Jupyter Notebook` to visualize the predictions made by the model.

You need to choose an image and pass it to the model to make predictions.
